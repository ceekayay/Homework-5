This is Homework #5 for ERHS 535.

This homework uses [data from the Washington Post](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides) 
on criminal homicides over the past decade in 50 of the largest American cities.

For this homework, I did **Choice 2**: 
Recreate the graph shown below. It shows monthly homicides in Baltimore, with a reference added for the date of the arrest of Freddie Gray and color used to show colder months (November through April) versus warmer months (May through October). There is a smooth line added to help show seasonal and long-term trends in this data.
